# Learning to Schedule

This project contains the code for implementing the preemptive-then-nonpreemtive empirical c\mu rule developed in the paper "Learning to Schedule".

## uniform service times.ipynb

This Python code implements the preemptive-then-nonpreemtive empirical c\mu rule for the setting where the service time of each job is deterministic and fixed at T. Figures 1 and 3 in the paper are drawn based on experiments run by this code. 

## heterogeneous service times.ipynb

This Python code implements the preemptive-then-nonpreemtive empirical c\mu rule for the setting where jobs have deterministic but heterogeneous service times. Figure 2 in the paper is drawn based on experiments run by this code.
